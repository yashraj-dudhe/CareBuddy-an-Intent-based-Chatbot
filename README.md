# CareBuddy - Mental Health Chatbot ü§ñüíô

CareBuddy is a mental health chatbot designed to provide accessible support, guidance, and resources for emotional well-being. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, CareBuddy can classify user intents, answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offer empathetic responses to help manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges.

## üöÄ Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Classifies user input into predefined categories using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **FAQ Matching**: Employs Sentence Transformers and cosine similarity to provide context-aware responses to common questions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using Streamlit for a seamless and user-friendly experience.
- **Fallback Responses**: Handles out-of-scope queries with generic but supportive responses.
- **Conversation Logging**: Logs interactions for monitoring and improvement.
- **Mental Health Awareness**: Promotes self-care and emotional well-being.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Intent data stored in a structured JSON format.
   - FAQ dataset created for mental health-related queries.

2. **Model Development**  
   - TF-IDF vectorizer converts user inputs into numerical features.
   - Logistic Regression model classifies inputs into predefined intents.
   - Sentence Transformers generate embeddings for FAQ questions and user queries.

3. **Response Mechanism**  
   - Classified intents or matched FAQs return specific responses.
   - Fallback mechanism ensures meaningful engagement for unrecognized queries.

4. **Interface and Deployment**  
   - Streamlit provides an interactive web-based interface for user interactions.
   - Conversation history logged for analysis and improvement.
